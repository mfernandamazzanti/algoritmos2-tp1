# Formal Specification and Correctness Proof â€“ TP1 (UBA)

This project was developed for the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at the University of Buenos Aires (FCEN, UBA).  
It focuses on **formal specification** of procedures and **proofs of partial correctness and termination** using the *Weakest Precondition* (WP) method.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

- Specified procedures using formal notation (pre/postconditions).
- Demonstrated partial correctness through the **Invariant Theorem**.
- Proved termination with the **Termination Theorem**.
- All written in LaTeX.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics

- Formal specification
- Loop invariants
- Weakest precondition (WP)
- Termination proofs
- Logical reasoning

## ðŸ“„ Tools

- [x] LaTeX  
- [x] Mathematical logic
